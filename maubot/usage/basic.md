# Basic usage
After setting up maubot, you can use the web management interface to make it do
things. The default location of the management interface is <http://localhost:29316/_matrix/maubot>.

Logging into the interface happens with the credentials configured in the
`admins` section in the config. Note that the `root` user can't have a password,
so you must use a different username for logging in.

## Uploading plugins
The first step is to upload a plugin. There's currently no central location to
download plugins, but the [maubot README](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) has
a list of plugins.

Common places to get plugins:
* GitHub releases (assets section), e.g. <https://github.com/maubot/echo/releases>
* mau.dev CI, e.g. <https://mau.dev/maubot/github/-/pipelines>
* Cloning the repo and building it yourself:
  * `mbc build` will package everything properly and output the `.mbp` file
  * you can also zip it yourself with `zip -9r plugin.mbp *`

After you have the `.mbp` file, click the `+` button next to the "Plugins"
header and drop your `.mbp` file in the upload box.

## Creating clients
To create a client, click the `+` button next to the "Clients" header and fill
in the form.

* The homeserver dropdown gets values from the config's `homeservers` section,
  but you can also type a full URL in that box.
* The access token and device ID are acquired by logging into the account.
  There are several ways to do that, including the [`mbc auth`] command included
  in maubot.
  * Note that encryption won't work if you reuse the token from an e2ee-capable
    client like Element, so make sure you get a fresh token if you want to use
    the bot in encrypted rooms.
* The avatar URL can be left empty, you can upload an image after creating the
  client.
* Both the display name and avatar URL can be set to `disable` if you don't want
  maubot to change them. If left empty, maubot will *remove* the displayname and
  avatar on Matrix.

## Creating instances
Instances are how plugins are linked to clients. After you have uploaded a
plugin and created a client, simply click the `+` button next to the "Instances"
header, choose your client and plugin in the relevant dropdowns, invent an
instance ID and click "Create".

You may have to refresh the management UI if the plugin and client you created
don't show up in the dropdowns.

If the plugin has any configuration options, the config editor will show up
under the created instance.
